## Overview
The existing manual student management system in educational institutions is time-consuming and error-prone. Administrative tasks, such as student course details retrieval and record-keeping are cumbersome and demanding for institutions with large student populations. Sometimes, inconsistency in student course enrollment is a stumbling block to efficient record-keeping. Additionally, data tracking, when done manually, poses a challenging workload for educational institutions' management.

To address these challenges, we have developed a simplified Student Management System. This system provides a simplified and user-friendly way of interacting and managing student-related information. It offers essential features for student course data management and course enrollment.

## Features
- **Log-In Page**: For authentication purposes.
- **Home Page**: Displays a quick 'about' of the system.
- **Enrollment**: Allows students to enroll in available courses.
- **Student Details**: Provides a basic summary of student enrollment and all their course details.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) includes the core features necessary for a functional student management system:
1. **Log-In Page**: Secure authentication for authorized users.
2. **Home Page**: Overview of the system.
3. **Enrollment**: Streamlined course enrollment for students.
4. **Student Details**: A summary of student enrollment and course details.

## Technologies Used

- **Back-end Development:**
   - **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python, used for building the server-side application.

     You can install Flask using pip, which comes with Python:

     create
     ```bash
     pipenv install
     ```
     activate
     ```bash
     pipenv shell
     ```
     install flask and its dependencies
     ```bash
     pip install Flask
     ```

- **Database:**
   - **SQLite**: A lightweight, serverless, and self-contained database for visualization of tables.

     SQLite is often included with Python by default, so you may not need to install it separately.

- **Object-Relational Mapping (ORM):**
   - **SQLAlchemy**: A Python SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for database interactions.

     You can install SQLAlchemy using pip:

     ```bash
     pip install SQLAlchemy
     ```

- **Version Control:**
   - **Git and GitHub**: Used for version control and collaboration among the development team.

- **Testing:**
   - **Pytest**: A testing framework for Python, ensuring the reliability and correctness of the application.

     You can install pytest using pip:

     ```bash
     pip install pytest
     ```
